# Suppose the memory content is as shown in the table along side. Write a program to subtract 16-bit data at memory location 8092 (2697H) from data at memory location 8090 (7963H). Store the result at memory location 8094 in reverse order. (16-bit data is always stored in two memory locations in reverse order)
